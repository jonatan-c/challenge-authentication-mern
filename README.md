App to authenticate users with JWT . 


## Tools

- Styles: CSS + Material UI
- Estado global: Redux Toolkit
- Router: React-Router-Dom v6
- Modals: SweetAlert2

- Node

## Instalation and run
```
cd backend
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm run dev

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

```

I push the env files to make it easier to run the app. In a real app, I would not do this.
How this is a app minor I did not use test and I did not use a logger. I did not used prettier , eslint , husky, convetional commit and branches (prod, staging , dev) to manage a standard code.
